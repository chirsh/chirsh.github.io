			<!--<img src="" width="" height="" />-->
			<p>After watching Shereef's chat I definitely feel excited to be at the start of Dev Bootcamp. His passion really came through the video in an infectious way.</p>

			<p>I honestly don't have much experience with this type of collaborative, "chef vs customer" type of learning. For the most part my education to this point has followed the consumer model that Shereef described. Becuase of this I definitely feel nervous about starting the program, but am also very excited.</p>

			<p>One of the other things that makes me nervous is that he describes DBC as only getting us through about 1% of what it takes to become a full-fledged developer. My fear there is how I can maintain a similar pace of learning after the program ends. However, I know from talking with DBC grads and others who work with them that it is a great program and very worthwile.</p>
