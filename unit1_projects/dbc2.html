		<h2>Mrs. O'Leary's Cow?</h2>
		
		<p><span class="fire">The great fire</span> is traditionally said to have been caused by Catherine O'Leary's cow kicking over a lantern in its barn on the night of October 8, 1871. The real cause was unclear, but the result was unmistakable, over the next two days fire destroyed 4 square miles of central Chicago.</p>

		<p>The immediete aftermath of the fire was hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and a third of the city's 300,000 residents without a home. As news spread, cities across America and abroad donated hundreds of thousands of dollars and various goods to the relief effort.</p>

		<h2>Positive Change in the Aftermath</h2>

		<p>Chicago quickly rebuilt, setting the city on a new grid system and improving fire standards. In 1884 the first skyscraper in the world was constructed in Chicago and in 1893, twenty-two years after the fire, the city hosted over twenty million people for the World's Columbian Exposition.</p>
