<h1>Hello DBC!</h1>

<a href="#A">Skip to my email</a>

<h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello! My name is Christopher Hirsh. I grew up just north of <b>Chicago</b> in a suburb called Wilmette,IL. After highschool I moved west to study at the Univeristy of California, <em>Berkeley</em>. I graduated about a year ago and have been back home in Illinois since then.</p>

<h3>Why Dev Bootcamp?</h3>
<p>Over the past year since I graduated from college I tried to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I have always been interested in technology and knew I wanted to work in that field, but wasn't exactly sure how to do it. I stumbled upon DBC and it seemed to be the perfect solution for someone like me with no technical background! <br> And now here I am! </P>

<h4> Some things I like to do </h4>
<ul>
	<li>Travel</li>
	<li>Learn to cook</li>
	<li>Read</li>
</ul>
